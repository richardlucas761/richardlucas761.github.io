This was the first DevOps Notts I had attended online and despite a few technical problems sharing the password for the Zoom meeting it was an interesting evening. I'll update this post later if I can get hold of the slides for either of the presentations.

## David McKay, InfluxDB - What is Cloud Native?

David's talk was fairly familiar to me having worked with Open Shift in the recent past creating micro services to deploy into a private cloud.

It was an overview of the tools and techniques for creating software to live inside a Docker container plus the surrounding infrastructure which makes service discovery and cross cutting concerns like logging using Fluentd possible.

## Stuart Pocklington, SoapVox - Why using the term developer makes me feel like an imposter!

Stuart's talk was a very personal journey through his career and how he ended up writing voice skills whilst battling against the imposter syndrome all developers struggle with!
