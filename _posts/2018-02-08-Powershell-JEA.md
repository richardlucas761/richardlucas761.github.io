# [Kickoff meeting for Nottingham and East Midlands PowerShell Usergroup](https://www.meetup.com/Nottingham-PowerShell-UserGroup/events/245663420/)

## JEA (Just Enough Adminstration) by Stuart Moore

> I'll be talking about JEA (Just Enough Adminstration), or how to let you users do Admin tasks in a safe, secure auditable way without giving them Adminstrator priveleges. If anyone else want to present a topic, that would be great. Or we can have a round table talking about problems, issues or just sharing obscure PowerShell facts if anyone's into that.

Stuart's talk (the first for the Nottingham and East Midlands PowerShell Usergroup) was about using JEA (Just Enough Administration).

Using JEA it's possible to create a secured end point for PowerShell administration tasks and specify contraints on what users can do.

It's also possible to enforce logging of actions taken so this is useful for giving people just enough access to systems to carry out administration rather than giving full admin rights.

This also helps with a particular person being a single point of failure, if an administration task with just enough rights is present then anyone reboot a series of servers in the right order without fear of missing something or doing something in the wrong order.

The demo code and slides (in PowerPoint format) are linked below and give examples of how to create JEA Modules:
