On 5 April I attended the **Introduction for Azure Services by Tobiasz Koprowski** at Accelerate Places in Nottingham.

A two part presentation (before and after the pizza break) with the description from the Meetup event as follows:

> Azure Services. Amazon Web Services. Cloud Computing. In February we celebrate the 7th anniversary of Azure Services (formerly known as Windows Azure), now called Microsoft Azure. Some of us use it daily. Some of us are trying to get to grips with how/if to use it at work... So let‘s talk about it! During the workshop we will dive into azure services: databases, virtual network, machines (not only virtual), security, storage... all the basics. We can discuss a little about SWOT analysis, costs, pros, and cons, risk, fun, and all the joys of working with The Cloud. I will be answering any questions you have on anything to do with Azure, and this will influence the direction of the workshop; I want to make sure everyone gets out of this session what they want to learn to give you the confidence you need to go and explore it yourselves! 

This was the first Notts Dev Workshop event I had attended and had a selection of free t-shirts, cookies, pizza and beer.

The talk was a good overview of Azure in general with some useful behind-the-scenes information about the Azure data centres around the world I wasn't previously aware of.
