On January 12 I attended the **PASS East Midlands January 2017 Meetup** at Capital One's offices in Nottingham, the first PASS East Midlands event I had attended.

The two sessions were as follows:

**Steph Middleton - Building a Robust SSIS Pipeline**

> SSIS is a simple concept - it takes data from a source and puts it in a destination.  But what if you can't trust your data?  In this session we will look at some simple ways to build resilience into your SSIS packages making it easier to track errors in your data and monitor what's happened.

**Stuart Moore - Index Consolidation**

> Have you inherited a database with too many indexes? Are your write operations spending more time updating indexes rather than your data? I'll be going through what makes a sensible indexing strategy, and what to do when someone hasn't followed a similar strategy

Both talks were interesting because I'd never used SSIS but it was interesting to see SSIS packages in action for bringing data into SQL Server, with useful reference material and sample projects to refer to later if I ever find myself involved in this sort of work.

If only my database problems at work were as simple as things like having to fine tune indexes... useful information about indexes I'd never considered before and useful reference material to refer to later when I start having to worry about simpler DBA issues again.
