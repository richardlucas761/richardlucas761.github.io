# Matteo Emili - “The computer says no” - Software quality in the DevOps world

<https://www.meetup.com/dotnetnotts/events/261020929/>

> “My code is perfect!” says or thinks pretty much everyone. In reality, there is so much that can go wrong.

> It could be something actually written in the code itself, and that would be the easy part. But it could also be a library or a combination of them. A provisioning script. Outdated components from another team, which you never updated because of miscommunication. Or stuff that should be encrypted but it isn’t, and now it is causing headaches.

> Welcome to the world of software quality in the DevOps world, a world where you need to be careful at every step. But is it so hard to do things the right way? Actually, not.

> This session is about all the tools you have at your disposal to make sure your code is not going to pose unnecessary risks (even down the line, months or years after being written!) and to make your Continuous Delivery pipelines better, more robust, and more resilient.
