## Digitising Work In The Gauche Digital Era by Rob van Tol

> We are in digital's awkward teenage years. One day our future robot overlords will smile condescendingly at the primitiveness of their younger selves. How clumsy were their first steps. How thicko their artificial intelligence. How tongue-tied their early chats. We, in the present day, have to design systems that have to put sticking plasters over their failings and limitations.
> At work, that means getting people to fill in when digital isn't quite good enough – often at the same time that you are disrupting people's traditional working patterns. Don't be surprised if the people involved aren't thrilled about this. This talk explores how to try and combine the two: the gauche digital and the often-reluctant workforce.

Rob's talk discussed the current state of technology and topics such as AI and the modern non-static web.

The issues with different working environments were presented where non desk based work is hard to digitise or environments where it's possible to have an entirely digital work flow, blended where there is a mixture and digitally supported where technology doesn't play as much of a role.

Digital Privilege is something we probably take for granted with the associated user interface skills, knowledge of design conventions and associated terminology. I've experienced this in the past whilst writing document management software for engineering, most engineers would be intelligent and very knowledgable in their field but not have much experience of computer systems.

Rob discussed two interesting case studies where work was done to digitise the paper driving test (the driving instructors notes) and make a digitial equivalent of a messy paper form which was as close to current practice as possible.

The second case talked about MOT test results recording where the environment and tools used were even more manual and messy than that for the driving test results. A related project for MOT reminders reminded me most people still prefer text messages over email messages and the issues with people with no digital skills.

This was an interesting talk and a reminder that software solutions aren't always possible or in some cases desirable, it's easy to fall into the trap of everything looking like a nail when you're a manufacturer of hammers.

## Lean Startup by Louise Paling

> The Lean Startup is an experiment-driven methodology aiming to reduce the risk of failure by conducting fast-paced iterations each testing a hypothesis. This talk will explain the methodology by taking you through the story of how it was created.

Louise's talk gave a quick introduction to the "Lean Startup" book by Eric Ries, discussing the problems associated with a start up company creating a new instant messaging 3D avatar system without first finding out whether people actually wanted to use it or buy it.

The point was made that the question shouldn't be whether we "can" do something but whether we "should", easier to find out at the start of a process you've got the wrong idea or you're producing something no-one wants.

An interesting proposition was made where if both the problem and solution are well understood that you can just use the Waterfall method (with the caveat you'll probably find you didn't understand the problem after all when you start creating a solution).

If the problem is well understood but the solution is a bit more vague then Agile can be used, most likely with the same warning that you probably still don't understand the problem as well as you think you do!

If both the problem and solution aren't well understood then Lean is a useful tool, for most projects the problem or solution isn't as clearly defined as you think so this raises the possibility of Lean being used in all of these cases, some food for thought.

Louise also recommended two books in addition to Eric Ries': "Our iceberg is melting" and "That's hot how we do it here" (definitely a phrase I'm familiar with!) and these are linked below.
