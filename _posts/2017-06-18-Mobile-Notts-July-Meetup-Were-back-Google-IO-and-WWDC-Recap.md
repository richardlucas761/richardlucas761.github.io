On 18 June 2017 I attended the **Mobile Notts July** Meetup at the Capital One offices in Nottingham, the first Mobile Notts meeting I had attended with two colleagues from PAREXEL who are working on mobile applications.

There were two talks presented this evening by Alex Trott plus Chris Anderson & Christian Göllner.

> This will be a WWDC & Google I/O recap session. We will walk you through all the new and exciting things that Apple and Google announced this year. 

Alex presented information from the Apple WWDC conference, giving information about updates to MacOS, TvOS, WatchOS and other news.

I'm not developing Apple software so most of the information was interesting but not directly relevant to me at the moment, the ARKit Augmented Reality framework demonstrated was admittedly very impressive!

The Swift programming language and the update from version 3 to version 4 was mentioned. This language like Kotlin was something I'd only been aware of from comments on the Tech Nottingham Slack channel and of course this post from Uncle Bob entitled The Dark Path.

Chris and Christian presented information from the Google I/O conference talking about Kotlin support as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

Instant Apps, a type of installation free apps and the necessary re-structuring of existing APK projects was discussed. Also the Android Things IoT offering which differed from the previous session I'd attended discussing the Microsoft IoT offerings, the emphasis here being on creating protoype devices and bringing them into production.

Again I'm not working on Android applications at the moment although I'd be more likely to start working on Android apps since I'm more of an Android fan.

The organisers were asking for volunteers to present and I jokingly suggested I could give a presentation on Windows Mobile 6.5.3 (this being the last mobile operating system I had written mobile apps for nearly five years ago).

I'm not sure there is much benefit in talking about devices with 64KB memory, very low power CPUs and terrible connectivity. Or working with the http://opennetcf.org/ framework plus manufacturers own versions of Windows mobile. Or the third-party barcode scanning applications. I'm sure these complications aren't still a problem for the latest generation of mobile developers, or perhaps there are new complications?
