## Microsoft Bot Framework by Gosia Borzęcka

> You don’t need a Bot for your organisation... Or do you?

> Bots are exciting and they can be very helpful tools that you can use to communicate inside your organisation or with your clients. They can answer frequently asked questions, create meetings with your co-workers or remind you that you need to follow up with a client.

> During this session we will cover how to create a Bot using the Microsoft Bot Framework, what development options we have, how to add more intelligence into the bot using various Cognitive Services and then finally, how to install the bot into your environment (SharePoint Online, MS Teams, Skype for Business) and then some general tips for long-term maintenance.

> Come and join the bot revolution! Or at least join this session…

Gosia gave an introduction to Bots from earlier expert systems like Eliza through to modern equivalents like Siri, Google Now, Cortana and etc.

The talk described the [Microsoft Bot Builder Framework 4](https://dev.botframework.com/) and making use of the related cognitive services like natural language processing.

The Bot framework emulator can be used locally to test your own C# code. QnaMaker can be used to create bots without writing any code.

## A/B Testing by Paula Besson

A/B testing is about improving systems by identifying something to change and creating a control group and one or more variations to test.

Users of a website are split into different groups who will see one of the variations and metrics can be collected to see whether they interacted with the different variations or not, suggesting which option is the best.

When there is enough statistically significant information to suggest a variation is an improvement it can be put into production.

There are commercial libraries available to help with testing and crunching the results or open source libraries on Github.
