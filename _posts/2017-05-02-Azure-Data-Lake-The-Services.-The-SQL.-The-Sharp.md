On 2 May I attended the **Azure Data Lake - The Services. The SQL. The Sharp** event at Accelerate Places in Nottingham. This event was presented by Paul Andrew and Alex Whittles from Purple Frog Systems.

> How do we implement Azure Data Lake?
>
> How does a lake fit into our data platform architecture? Is Data Lake going to run in isolation or be part of a larger pipeline?
>
> How do we use and work with USQL?
>
> Does size matter?!
>
> The answers to all these questions and more in this session as we immerse ourselves in the lake, that’s in a cloud.
> We'll take an end to end look at the components and understand why the compute and storage are separate services.
> For the developers, what tools should we be using and where should we deploy our USQL scripts. Also, what options are available for handling our C# code behind and supporting assemblies.
> We’ll cover everything you need to know to get started developing data solutions with Azure Data Lake.

This event was a different format to the previous event on Azure Services with a hands-on session with a chance to try using Azure Data Lake.

This was my first exposure to USQL and although I'm not working on Azure data warehouse solutions at the moment this was a great technical introduction with excellent hand out material with Visual Studio projects to take home and try.

From a comment between the presenters that some of the code presented being deprecated I hadn't previously considered the problems of deploying to any cloud environment because there is effectively only one live platform, this isn't an issue as long as all changes are non-breaking and backwards compatible.

Being used to working in a heavily regulated environment with isolated development, testing, controlled testing, user acceptance testing and live environments this highlighted one of the differences of cloud based software development.
