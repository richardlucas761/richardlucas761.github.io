## Let’s Play A Game: A Quick Introduction To Gamification by Jorge Andrés Martínez and Nader Al-Shamma

> Ever wondered how you can put a little fun back into your work? In this talk Nader and Jorge give a high-level introduction to Gamification. How playful game mechanics can be implemented in everyday life and work to help increase motivation, encourage greater engagement and foster greater collaboration. The talk will be presented by Nader Al-Shamma and Jorge Andrés Martínez who will walk through the basics of what gamification is, to whom it may appeal to, why organisations might want to adopt it and how it can be implemented.

Gamification was described as a safe environment for teaching with feedback on the consequences of your actions.

There are 32.4 million "gamers" in the UK with a 48% female and 52% male split. The UK is the 5th largest consumer of games. The average "gamer" is 24-34 years old.

Goods, Glory, Games and God were described as motiviations for gaming, structured leisure or a level of attainment or the ability to impact on other people's lives.

Some of the techniques of gamification include Progress Bars and Medals (think Xbox Live achievements) and Loops like loyalty cards where 6 stamps gives you a free coffee.

Gamer Traits were discussed which included Competitors, Socialisers, Collecters and Explorers.

The business applications for Gamification were presented in the context of the Giff Gaff network where you can complete a series of "missions" after signing up to the network. The difference with Giff Gaff is users providing support to other users to gain ranking, achieving the best customer satisfaction through user volunteers.

> Have you ever heard the terms “trade mark”, “patent” or “copyright” and wonder what they mean? Have you created something new and are wondering how to protect your invention? In this talk Kulpreet will explain the basics of intellectual property rights, including the different types of intellectual property rights, why they are important and how you can protect them.

Kulpreet described IP rights and inventions, logos, patents and trade marks.

Patents need to be registered and persist for 20 years.

Trade marks are business identifiers such as the specific "Cadbury's purple" colour. The existence of Pokemon Moon was leaked to the world via a trade mark.

Design Rights are for how something looks such as the design of the Coca Cola bottle.

Copyright is automatically applied in the UK and lasts for between 50 and 70 years. There are exceptions for creations whilst employed by a company.
